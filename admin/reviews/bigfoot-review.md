**BigFoot.js**

**Overview**

**Bigfoot.js** is a lightweight jQuery plugin designed to enhance the experience of footnotes on web pages. It transforms traditional footnote links into interactive, popover-style footnotes, improving readability and user engagement by reducing the need for users to scroll through the page.

**Installation**  
There are many ways to use bigfoot.js:

1. Direct download  
   You can download the latest release of Bigfoot.js from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) or from [jQueryScript.net](https://www.jqueryscript.net/), and then just add the JavaScript and CSS files to your project.  
     
2. Npm install  
   You can install bigfoot.js via npm. Just run the following command in the terminal  
   “npm install bigfoot.js”  
     
3. Via CDN (Content Delivery Network)  
   You can directly use bigfoot.js without having to download them explicitly. Just include the following lines in your code  
   \<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bigfoot.js/dist/bigfoot-default.css"\>  
   \<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js"\>\</script\>  
   \<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bigfoot.js/dist/bigfoot.min.js"\>\</script\>

### 

**Design decisions**

**Popovers for Footnotes**:

* **Decision**: Instead of traditional footnotes that require users to scroll to the bottom of the page, Bigfoot.js uses popovers to display footnotes directly next to the reference.  
* **Reason**: This enhances user experience by keeping readers engaged with the content and reducing interruptions, especially on mobile devices where scrolling can be cumbersome.

**Customizability**:

* **Decision**: Bigfoot.js provides a range of customizable options, such as controlling how long popovers remain open or whether multiple footnotes can be active at the same time.  
* **Reason**: This flexibility allows developers to adapt the plugin to different use cases or preferences, ensuring it can be integrated into diverse websites without requiring major changes.

**jQuery-Based**:

* **Decision**: The plugin is built on jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.  
* **Reason**: At the time of development, jQuery was widely adopted and provided a reliable, cross-browser solution for manipulating the DOM and handling events. This decision made the plugin more accessible to developers familiar with the jQuery ecosystem.

### **Code Structure Evaluation**

The structure of the **Bigfoot.js** project is easy to understand and well-organized.

1. **dist**: Contains production-ready, minified files. This separation of source and build files is a good practice for deployment.  
2. **src**:  
   * **coffee**: Uses CoffeeScript for DOM manipulation via jQuery. This adds complexity, as CoffeeScript is outdated and transitioning to plain JavaScript or TypeScript would simplify development.  
   * **scss**: Organized by component (e.g., popover, button), which is a strong design choice for maintainable and modular styles.  
3. **.gitignore**: Properly excludes unnecessary files, maintaining a clean repo.  
4. **Gruntfile.coffee**: Automates tasks via Grunt, though modern tools like **Webpack** or **Gulp** would provide more flexibility.  
5. **LICENSE.md** and **README.md**: Essential files ensuring clear licensing and user-friendly documentation.

The in-code documentation within **Bigfoot.js** is highly explicit and well-structured, providing clear and concise comments that guide developers through the problem, solution, and functionality of various code sections. Each major function or module is accompanied by comments that explain its purpose, the challenge it addresses, and the specific approach taken to implement the solution. This level of detail makes it easier for developers to understand the flow of the code. The clarity in highlighting the problem-solution structure enhances maintainability and speeds up the learning curve for new developers working with the project. 

**Would we use bigfoot?**

Probably not.

1. Bigfoot.js relies on jQuery, which can add extra overhead if your project doesn't already use it.  
   Mitigation: Rewrite the footnote functionality in pure JavaScript.  
   Effort: High/Medium \- depending on number of developers.  
2. Without unit, integration, or end-to-end tests, bugs and regressions can easily go undetected.  
   Mitigation: Set up automated testing with a JavaScript testing framework. Start by writing unit tests for key components, and gradually expand to integration and end-to-end tests.  
   Effort: Initially, writing tests for an untested codebase requires a deep understanding of the code.   
3. CoffeeScript has lost traction due to the rise of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015\) and other modern JavaScript features. Fewer developers and resources are available to support CoffeeScript projects.  
   Mitigation: Convert CoffeeScript files to modern JavaScript. Features like arrow functions, classes, destructuring, and async/await, which made CoffeeScript initially attractive are now natively supported in JavaScript.  
   Effort: This involves rewriting the codebase, ensuring the same functionality in JavaScript. Depending on the size of the codebase, this could take weeks to months.
