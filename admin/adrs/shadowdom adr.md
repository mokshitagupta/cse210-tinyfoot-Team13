# ADR: Shadow DOM for Footnote Manipulation

## Context and Problem Statement
We needed a robust and maintainable way to manage footnotes' open, close, and manipulation functionalities in our tinyfoot web application. The main challenge was to encapsulate the footnote UI components while preventing styles and scripts from interfering with the rest of the page. How can we create an isolated environment for footnote components without affecting global styles?

## Decision Drivers
- **Encapsulation**: Avoid interference with the main DOM and global styles.
- **Maintainability**: Create a reusable and modular component for footnotes.
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient rendering and event handling of footnotes.

## Consequences
- **Good**, because Shadow DOM provides style and event encapsulation, preventing conflicts with the rest of the page.
- **Good**, because the implementation results in improved webpage performance, leading to faster rendering times and enhanced responsiveness when interacting with footnotes compared to other option.
- **Bad**, because certain global styling or scripting modifications may not penetrate the Shadow DOM unless explicitly allowed, potentially leading to styling inconsistencies.


## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Shadow DOM for encapsulation**, because it isolates the footnote component styles and scripts from the global scope, while being lightweight and more maintainable compared to a custom event-driven solution.

## Consequences
- **Good**, because Shadow DOM provides style and event encapsulation, preventing conflicts with the rest of the page. 
- **Bad**, because certain global styling or scripting modifications may not penetrate the Shadow DOM unless explicitly allowed, potentially leading to styling inconsistencies.

## Confirmation
This decision will be validated through code reviews and testing to ensure footnote functionality is fully encapsulated and performs as expected. Regular reviews will confirm that the use of Shadow DOM is not leading to unforeseen issues with other components.

## Pros and Cons of the Options
### JavaScript Functions for Control
- **Good**, because it's simple to implement and provides full control over the behavior of footnotes and easy to debug and directly manipulate the DOM.
- **Bad**, because it doesn't provide style encapsulation, making it prone to global style and script conflicts.
- **Bad**, because the lack of isolation can make the component harder to maintain as the application grows.

### Shadow DOM for Encapsulation
- **Good**, because it ensures full isolation of the footnote component, preventing interference with global styles or scripts.
- **Good**, because it's supported by most modern browsers and provides a clean way to encapsulate custom elements.
- **Bad**, because certain global features (e.g., accessibility hooks, global theming) may require extra configuration to work with the Shadow DOM.

### Custom Event-Driven Mechanism
- **Good**, because it allows for dynamic control of footnote visibility through event listeners and custom events, leading to a responsive user experience.
- **Bad**, because it adds complexity to the architecture, requiring careful management of event propagation and listener registration.
- **Bad**, because it may introduce challenges in debugging if events do not trigger as expected.
